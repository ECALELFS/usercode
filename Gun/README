GUN generation guide:

1) Define parameter:
In SingleEtaE10_cfi_py_GEN_SIM_DIGI_L1_DIGI2RAW_RAW2DIGI_L1Reco_RECO.py you can choose the Pt eta range. Also the particle ID is defined there. 
You can run with: cmsRun SingleEtaE10_cfi_py_GEN_SIM_DIGI_L1_DIGI2RAW_RAW2DIGI_L1Reco_RECO.py

2) Crab
For big production you have to run on Crab.
If you want to store on EOS/group and publish, you have to change the path in crab, since if you write the correct one in the crab_group.cfg than crab doesn't find it.
To change the Crab_dir/res files:
source CorrecrtPathStage.sh
