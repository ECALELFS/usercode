To write down the IC in a GT:

cmsRun testReaddbWriteXML_201X.py; where X is the year you need

it will give uyou an xml ooutput like EcalIntercalibConstants_GR_H_V22.xm.

In general the .py you use need to have:
1) The GT, ex: GR_H_V22::All
2) The Run number of a good event, ex: firstValue = cms.uint64(177730), lastValue = cms.uint64(177731),
3) And of course take care all the other variable are setted in the right way.
